            <h3>History of DEI</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Dayalbagh Educational Institute (DEI) is an educational institution located at Dayalbagh in Agra. The institute has been given deemed university status by the University Grants Commission of India in 1981.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded as a primary school in 1917, and becoming a technical college in 1927 for training in automobile, electrical and mechanical engineering, it later developed into a Deemed University. Prof. M. B. Lal Sahab, a former Vice Chancellor of the Lucknow University, founded this institution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The foundation of DEI goes back to 1917, with the foundation of Radhasoami Educational Institute. Soon after Dayalbagh was founded in 1915, the Radhasoami Satsang Sabha started the Radhasoami Educational Institute, as a co-educational Middle School, open to all, on 1 January 1917 administered by a Managing Committee registered under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860. The institute got divided and also spawned new institutions. Within six months, it was raised to the level of a High School; Intermediate classes were started in 1922; it became a Degree College in 1947, with the introduction of B.Com. classes affiliated to Agra University; B.Ed. (B.T.) classes were added in 1951 and the first batch of B.Sc. students was sent up for the final examination in 1955.
