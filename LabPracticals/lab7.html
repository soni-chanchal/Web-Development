        <h4 style="color: brown;">Agra Fort [Inline CSS Applied]</h4>
        <p style="background-color: aliceblue; color: blue;">
            The Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra and also known as Agra's Black Fort. Built by the
            Mughal emperor Akbar in 1565 and completed in 1573, it served as the main residence of the rulers of the
            Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was also known as the
            “Lal-Qila”, “Fort Rouge” or “Qila-i-Akbari”.[1] Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to
            have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was life inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage
            Site.[2] It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be
            more accurately described as a walled city.

        <p style="background-color: aliceblue; color: blue;">
            Like the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort prior to Mahmud Ghaznavi's invasion is unclear. However, in
            the 15th century, the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when
            Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487–1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the
            pre-existing fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled
            from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The fort was given its present appearance during the reign
            of Akbar (A.D. 1556–1605). Later this fort was under the rule of Jats of Bharatpur for 13 years.

        <p class="inline-p">
            The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses
            nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in
            memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the
            mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added
            subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in
            Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons,
            stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were
            requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was
            the main architect of the Taj Mahal.
        </p>
        <p class="inline-p">
            The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic
            architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave
            and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour
            combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever
            changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi precious stones make it
            a monument apart.

        <h4 class="external-h">Dayalbagh [External CSS Applied]</h4>
        <p class="external-p">
            Dayalbagh or Dayal Bagh means 'Garden' (bagh) of 'Merciful' (dayal), inferring "Garden of the Merciful", is
            a locality in metropolitan Agra in western Uttar Pradesh, India. It is the headquarters of the Dayalbagh
            subsect of the Radha Soami sect[1][2] where the 8th revered leader (Sant Satguru) lives and presides over
            the satsang (holy service).
            It is a self-sustained colony, where its inhabitants lead an active, disciplined and co-operative community
            life, conforming to the spiritual ideals of their faith. It has affiliated educational institutes such as
            the Dayalbagh Educational Institute affiliated to Dayalbagh University (deemed). Radhasoami Satsang Sabha is
            the chief working committee of Radhasoami Faith Dayalbagh.
        </p>
        <p class="external-p">
            The colony of Dayalbagh was founded on the Basant Day (translation: first day of spring) on 15 January 1915 by Sir Anand Swarup (Huzur Sahab Ji Maharaj), the Fifth Revered Leader of Radha Soami sect, as an ashram or a spiritual home for the followers of the faith, by planting a mulberry tree. The colony was built by the voluntary contribution (by money as well as labor) of the early residents, who considered it as Sewa (social service). The fields near Yamuna river were also acquired by Dayalbagh and as a daily practice, residents and devotees coming from outside leveled the uneven landmass and irrigated it, making it a fertile land from the barren desert. Today also, the devotees give their voluntary contribution everyday in agricultural activities in the fields.
